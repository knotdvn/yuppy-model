                <h1>The Yuppy Context</h1>
                    <section>
                        <p>Online retailers, such as Amazon.com, provide a referral sales program which enables independent owners and operators of websites to earn a percentage of all qualifying purchases made when the shopping session originates from the independent website.</p>

                        <p>The model and analysis proposed herein specifically targets the revenue potential and cost associated with owning and operating a website for the purpose of generating sales referrals. <strong>A site of this type is herby refered to as "a yuppy" or "yuppy".</strong></p>

                        <p>Any potential or current owner/operator of a website can plug in their own yuppy into this modelss data points and help calculate and predict the profitability of their sales referral endeavor. Specifically, the curator of yuppy needs to decide which categories of products to target. Using the amount of traffic and level of interactivity of the site's user base, the site moderator will have to determine which sector of Amazon's payout chart will be most profitable.</p>

                        <p>E-commerce sites, especially sales referral or "drop ship" sites, are particularly interesting because they require no physical action on the part of the site operator. Inventory, infrastructure, shipping, and customer service is all handled by the actual retailer.</p>

                        <p>The main focus of a yuppy is to attract site visitors and convert them to customers. Major retailers have this as one of their main tasks as well; however, the operator of a yuppy is willing to bet that they can perform this task just as well, if not better. Perhaps by focusing on unique niches and effectively engaging and communicating with those communities, the operator of a yuppy can find success.</p>
