                        <p>I, Deven Edward Pitcher, am a Masters Student at <a href="http://syr.edu">Syracuse University</a>,
                    	 specifically the <a href="http://ischool.syr.edu">School of Information Studies ( iSchool )</a> in the <a href="http://ischool.syr.edu/future/grad/im.aspx">Information Management degree program</a>. I've recently begun to see the appeal of a large salary and a pleasant working environment.</p>
                    	 <p>Personally, I have studied web engineering from a diverse interdisciplinary background. I've acquired  comprehensive technical skills in math, engineering, and computer science; however, I've paired these disciplines with a passioned study of the human condition. I fell in love with  my Bachelors of Science in <a href="http://catalog.oswego.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=26&poid=2553">Cognitive Science</a> from <a href="http://www.oswego.edu/">the State University of New York at Oswego</a>, which required a distinct and creative approach to the computational exploitation of the abstract: new ways of representing old problems, framing questions in a new light so that the answers become obvious, and breaking the big ideas into little manageable pieces. I have mental cravings for new ideas, and an insatiable desire to explore farther and develop further.</p>
                    	 <p>I sharpen my teeth daily on the very real and concrete issues of web functionality, accessibility, standards compliance, and feature requirements. I write code, I fix bugs, and essentially I solve problems everyday. I build complex websites with cutting edge enhancements. I optimize page load times and ensure that the code I write enables the user, client, or customer to engage in an intuitive and enjoyable experience.</p>
